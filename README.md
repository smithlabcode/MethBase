# methbase
Thousands of high-quality analyzed methylomes.

If you would like to suggest a publicly available methylome for
inclusion in methbase, please submit an issue
[here](https://github.com/smithlabcode/methbase/issues).

The methbase database includes many more methylomes than are available
for viewing with the methbase track hub. Those selected for the track
hub meet criteria that help ensure they have been analyzed correctly.

Currently the criteria are:

- 0.9: Minimum bisulfite conversion rate.
- 1.0: Minimum average coverage across the genome.
- 0.8: Minimum fraction of CpG sites covered.
